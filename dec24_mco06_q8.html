  <h1>Write short notes on:</h1>

  <h2>(a) Marketing Communication</h2>
  <p>
    Marketing communication refers to the various methods and channels that a business uses to convey messages about its products or services to the target audience. It includes advertising, public relations, personal selling, direct marketing, and digital promotions. The goal is to inform, persuade, and remind customers, and to build strong brand awareness.
  </p>
  <p>
    Effective marketing communication ensures a consistent brand message across all platforms and helps in developing customer trust and loyalty.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> Coca-Cola uses integrated marketing communication through TV ads, social media campaigns, and promotional events to reach a global audience.</p>

  <h2>(b) Sales Promotion</h2>
  <p>
    Sales promotion involves short-term incentives designed to encourage the purchase or sale of a product or service. It aims to create urgency and boost immediate sales.
  </p>
  <p>
    Techniques include discounts, coupons, contests, free samples, loyalty programs, and "buy one get one free" offers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sales promotions are especially useful during product launches, seasonal sales, or when facing intense market competition.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> A supermarket offering 20% off on groceries during a festival season is using sales promotion to increase footfall and sales.</p>

  <h2>(c) Objectives of Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    Advertising is a paid form of non-personal communication aimed at promoting products, services, or ideas. Its main objectives include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Informing:</strong> Introducing new products or informing about features and uses.</li>
    <li><strong>Persuading:</strong> Influencing consumer behavior to choose one brand over another.</li>
    <li><strong>Reminding:</strong> Keeping the brand in the consumerâ€™s mind after the initial promotion.</li>
    <li><strong>Building Brand Image:</strong> Enhancing reputation and positioning in the market.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> An ad campaign by Apple showcasing innovative features in the latest iPhone serves to inform and persuade potential buyers.</p>

  <h2>(d) Marketing of Services</h2>
  <p>
    Marketing of services is the process of promoting and selling intangible offerings such as banking, insurance, education, tourism, and healthcare. Unlike physical goods, services are characterized by intangibility, inseparability, variability, and perishability.
  </p>
  <p>
    The marketing mix for services includes 7 Ps: Product, Price, Place, Promotion, People, Process, and Physical evidence.
  </p>
  <p>
    Building customer trust, ensuring service quality, and managing customer relationships are crucial in service marketing.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> A hotel promoting its excellent customer service, clean environment, and online booking facility is engaging in service marketing.</p>
