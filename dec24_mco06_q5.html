  <h1>Question: XYZ company is planning to develop a new product and launch in the market. What process shall the marketing manager follow to develop the new product? Discuss.</h1>

  <p>When XYZ company plans to launch a new product, the marketing manager must follow a structured process to ensure successful development and introduction in the market. The key stages in the new product development (NPD) process are as follows:</p>

  <h2>1. Idea Generation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Gather ideas from various sources like employees, customers, competitors, R&D, and market research.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Suggestions from sales teams or customer feedback may inspire a new tech gadget or feature.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Idea Screening</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Filter out unfeasible or non-profitable ideas and retain only viable ones.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> An idea requiring very high production costs might be rejected at this stage.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Concept Development and Testing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Develop a detailed version of the idea and test it with a sample of target consumers.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Presenting a product concept for a new energy drink to health-conscious consumers to assess appeal.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Business Analysis</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Evaluate the productâ€™s potential profitability by analyzing costs, sales forecasts, and ROI.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Estimating how many units can be sold monthly and what profit margins can be expected.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Product Development</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Create the actual product. This involves engineering, design, and prototype creation.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Developing a working prototype of a smartwatch with unique health-tracking features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Test Marketing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Launch the product in a limited market to evaluate customer response and identify improvements.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Introducing the product in selected cities before a nationwide launch.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Commercialization</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Full-scale launch of the product with proper distribution, promotion, and pricing strategies.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Launching the new product across India with advertising campaigns and retail placement.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>By following these systematic stages, the marketing manager can reduce the risk of product failure and ensure that the new product meets customer expectations, aligns with market needs, and achieves business goals.</p>
