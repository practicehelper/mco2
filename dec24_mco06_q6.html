  <h1>Question:</h1>
  <p><strong>Explain cost-based pricing methods with suitable examples.</strong></p>

  <h1>Answer: Cost-Based Pricing Methods</h1>

  <p>Cost-based pricing is a pricing strategy in which the price of a product is determined by adding a fixed percentage (or markup) to the total cost of producing the product. This approach ensures that the business covers its costs and earns a reasonable profit. There are several methods under cost-based pricing:</p>

  <h2>1. Cost-Plus Pricing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The selling price is determined by adding a fixed percentage (markup) to the cost of the product.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> If the cost to produce a table is ₹1,000 and the company adds a 20% markup, the selling price becomes ₹1,200.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Mark-Up Pricing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> This method is often used in retail. A predetermined percentage is added to the cost price to determine the final price.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> A retailer buys a shirt for ₹500 and adds a 50% markup, resulting in a selling price of ₹750.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Break-Even Pricing (Target Profit Pricing)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Price is set to cover costs and achieve a target profit. The company calculates how many units must be sold to break even or earn a target return.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> If fixed costs are ₹50,000, variable cost per unit is ₹200, and the company wants a profit of ₹20,000, the price is set to recover total cost and profit over expected sales volume.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Marginal Cost Pricing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The price is based only on variable or marginal cost, ignoring fixed costs. This method is often used for short-term pricing decisions or during tough competition.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> If the marginal cost of producing an additional mobile phone is ₹5,000, the firm might sell it at ₹5,500 to cover variable costs and stay competitive.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Cost-based pricing methods are simple and ensure that the company covers its costs and earns a profit. However, these methods may not always consider customer demand or competitor pricing, so companies must use them carefully based on the market situation.</p>
