  <h1>Bases for Segmenting Consumer Markets</h1>

  <p>Market segmentation involves dividing a broad consumer or business market into sub-groups of consumers based on some type of shared characteristics. Here are the major bases for segmenting consumer markets:</p>

  <h2>1. Geographic Segmentation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Dividing the market based on location such as countries, states, cities, or neighborhoods.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> A woolen clothing brand may target customers in colder regions like Himachal Pradesh rather than in Kerala.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Demographic Segmentation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Segmentation based on measurable statistics such as age, gender, income, education, occupation, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Age: Toys are marketed to children, while anti-aging creams target older adults.</li>
        <li>Gender: Cosmetic brands like Lakm√© focus on women, while Gillette caters to men.</li>
        <li>Income: Luxury brands like Rolex or BMW target high-income groups.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Psychographic Segmentation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Segmentation based on lifestyle, personality traits, values, or social class.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> A premium fitness brand may target health-conscious and active lifestyle consumers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Behavioral Segmentation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Dividing the market based on consumer knowledge, attitudes, usage, or responses to a product.</li>
    <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Usage Rate: Telecom companies offer different plans for light, medium, and heavy users.</li>
        <li>Loyalty Status: Brands like Starbucks reward loyal customers through special discounts.</li>
        <li>Occasion: Greeting cards are marketed differently for birthdays, weddings, or festivals.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Effective market segmentation allows companies to better satisfy customer needs by tailoring their marketing strategies. Choosing the right basis of segmentation ensures better targeting and positioning of the product in the market.</p>
