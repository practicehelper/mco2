    <h2>2. Steps in Conducting a Marketing Research Study (12 Marks)</h2>

    <h3>a) Problem Definition</h3>
    <p>
        The first and most critical step is to clearly define the research problem. This includes identifying the issue that needs to be studied, setting objectives, and understanding the information requirements.
    </p>

    <h3>b) Developing the Research Plan</h3>
    <p>
        In this stage, the researcher decides on the type of research (exploratory, descriptive, or causal), sources of data (primary or secondary), research approach (survey, observation, experiment), contact methods, sampling plan, and instruments for data collection (questionnaires, interviews, etc.).
    </p>

    <h3>c) Collecting the Data</h3>
    <p>
        This involves gathering the required information from selected respondents or sources. It is often the most time-consuming and expensive step, and must be carried out with accuracy to avoid errors or biases.
    </p>

    <h3>d) Analyzing the Data</h3>
    <p>
        Once data is collected, it is cleaned, processed, and analyzed using statistical tools and software to identify patterns, correlations, or insights that can support marketing decisions.
    </p>

    <h3>e) Interpreting and Reporting the Findings</h3>
    <p>
        The insights drawn from the analysis are interpreted in relation to the research problem. The results are then summarized in a report, often with graphs, charts, and tables for clarity. Recommendations for action are also included.
    </p>

    <h3>f) Making Informed Marketing Decisions</h3>
    <p>
        Finally, the findings are used by management to make informed decisions such as product modifications, pricing changes, promotional strategies, or market entry tactics.
